Scenario: Inventory Analysis for Restocking Decisions

Objective: Determine which products need to be restocked, identify the fastest-moving items over the last quarter, and assess supplier reliability in terms of lead time.

Database Schema
- `products` (product_id, name, supplier_id, price)
- `suppliers` (supplier_id, name, lead_time_days)
- `inventory_levels` (product_id, date, quantity)
- `orders` (order_id, product_id, order_date, quantity_ordered)

Complex SQL Query
This SQL query integrates data across all tables to provide insights into inventory needs, product movement, and supplier performance:

WITH OrderedProducts AS (
    SELECT
        product_id,
        SUM(quantity_ordered) AS total_ordered,
        RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(quantity_ordered) DESC) AS rank
    FROM orders
    WHERE order_date BETWEEN DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 3 MONTH) AND CURDATE()
    GROUP BY product_id
),
LowStock AS (
    SELECT
        i.product_id,
        p.name,
        MIN(i.quantity) AS min_quantity
    FROM inventory_levels i
    JOIN products p ON i.product_id = p.product_id
    WHERE i.date BETWEEN DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH) AND CURDATE()
    GROUP BY i.product_id
    HAVING min_quantity < 20 -- Threshold for restocking might vary
),
SupplierLeadTimes AS (
    SELECT
        p.product_id,
        s.name AS supplier_name,
        AVG(s.lead_time_days) AS average_lead_time
    FROM suppliers s
    JOIN products p ON s.supplier_id = p.supplier_id
    GROUP BY p.product_id
)

SELECT
    op.product_id,
    p.name,
    ls.min_quantity AS current_stock,
    op.total_ordered AS total_orders_last_quarter,
    sl.supplier_name,
    sl.average_lead_time,
    CASE
        WHEN op.rank <= 5 THEN 'High'
        WHEN op.rank BETWEEN 6 AND 15 THEN 'Medium'
        ELSE 'Low'
    END AS demand_level
FROM OrderedProducts op
JOIN products p ON op.product_id = p.product_id
JOIN LowStock ls ON op.product_id = ls.product_id
JOIN SupplierLeadTimes sl ON op.product_id = sl.product_id
ORDER BY op.rank;

Explanation:
1. **OrderedProducts CTE (Common Table Expression)**: Calculates total orders for each product in the last quarter and ranks products by the volume of orders.
2. **LowStock CTE**: Identifies products with low stock levels (below a threshold, e.g., 20 units) over the last month.
3. **SupplierLeadTimes CTE**: Provides average lead times for each supplier based on the products they supply.
4. **Final SELECT**: Combines all CTEs to provide a comprehensive view of each productâ€™s demand level, current stock, total orders in the last quarter, supplier, and average lead time. It also categorizes demand levels based on order volume rankings.
